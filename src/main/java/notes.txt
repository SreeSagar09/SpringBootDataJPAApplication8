A Program to show how to implement custom query building using EntityManager, Query interfaces:
Programs:
* SpringBootDataJPAApplication8Application.java
* Employee.java
* EmployeeCustomRepository.java
* EmployeeCustomRepositoryImpl.java
* TestRunner.java
Notes:
* The @PersistenceContext to expresses a dependency on a container-managed EntityManager and its associated persistence context.
* The @PersistenceContext annotation can be used at class level, method level and field level.
* The EntityManager interface is used to interact with the persistence context.
* An EntityManager instance is associated with a persistence context. A persistence context is a set of entity instances in which for any persistent entity identity there is a unique entity instance.
* The Query interface is used to control query execution, and it provide many methods to controlling query execution. 
Output:
